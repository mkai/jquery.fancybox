jquery.fancybox http://fancybox.net/ by Janis Skarnelis with some smaller enhancements.

2010-11-16 
Added two options that allow for fading in the overlay as well as for setting the speed for fading it out.

    overlaySpeedIn: 500,
    overlaySpeedOut: 500

Added a callback that decides if the overlay should really be closed:
    
    onBeforeClose: function() {
        return window.confirm('Are you sure you want to close?');
    }
    
If the method returns true, $.fancybox.close() will be called, otherwise it does nothing.
